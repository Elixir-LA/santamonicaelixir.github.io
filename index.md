#### Where did we meet?

Carbon Five Santa Monica

#### What happened?

We regrouped and talked through the Portal demo, highlighting some
instances of what we learned about Agents and the OTP architecture.

We brainstormed a bunch of game ideas from real-time battles, to
turn-based MMO games, and finally settled on a multiplayer party game
[werewolf]() to build out.

We initialized the [Github repo](https://github.com/SantaMonicaElixir/werewolf) and
added our first Phoenix commit.

We drew up an experience map illustrating the basic game workflow and
game mechanics.

#### What's next?

Andrew committed to committing a first draft home page and login page
for code review by the next week.

Andrew began writing up each feature as a GitHub issue.

Next week, we are going to go over Phoenix.
